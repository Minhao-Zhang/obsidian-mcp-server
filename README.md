# Obsidian MCP Server

This is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server implementation for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

This project uses TypeScript to provide type checking and documentation.
The repo depends on the latest plugin API (obsidian.d.ts) in TypeScript Definition format, which contains TSDoc comments describing what it does.

This plugin implements the MCP protocol to enable communication between Obsidian and external services through a standardized interface.
